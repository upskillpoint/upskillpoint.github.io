"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess."-<b><i> Ronald Coase</i></b>

Welcome to my page :-)

I'm an AI enthusiast, having experience in various technologies, platforms and coding languages.
Bitten by the 'Artificial Intelligence in everyday life' bug, I specialize in machine learning techniques, chat bots, tableau, RPA.
In my spare time , I read a lot about these technologies to explore more and more.
<p>I believe its easier to learn difficult things when you make them fun and I keep this in my mind every time working on a project.
I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out to me for some interesting collaboration!</p>
